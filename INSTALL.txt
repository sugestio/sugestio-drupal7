* Fivestar module <http://drupal.org/project/fivestar>

-- INSTALLATION --

* Begin by ensuring the Libraries and Fivestar modules are installed and enabled

* Upload the Sugestio PHP library to [/sites/all]/libraries/sugestio-php

* Upload this module to [/sites/all]/modules/sugestio 

* Ensure that your file and directory structure look like this:

  [/sites/all]/libraries/sugestio-php
                           |- SugestioClient.php
                           |- SugestioConsumption.php
                           |- ...
                           
  [/sites/all]/modules/sugestio
                           |- sugestio.info
                           |- sugestio.install
                           |- sugestio.module
                           |- ...
                           
* The Sugestio PHP library has a Settings.php. You do not have to edit this file, 
everything can be configured through Drupal's administration system.

* Go to Modules and enable the Sugestio module

* Go to Configuration > Search and metadata > Sugestio settings and make any changes

* By default, the Sugestio module is configured to use the Sandbox account credentials 
and will work out of the box. If you use the fivestar voting system on your website, 
votes will now be automatically submitted to the Sugestio service, 
where they will be discarded. See README.md for more information about the Sandbox.
